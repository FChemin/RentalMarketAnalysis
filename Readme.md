This is a project used to build a web scraper and analyze the rental market
in the city of Brest, France.

First, you need to run the 'get_ads_links' function with your zipcode to obtain
all the links.
Then, use the extractor 'get_ads_details' to extract all relevant informations.
We use the Sys.sleep() function to not overload the web servers...

You can find the analysis (french language) at this url:
